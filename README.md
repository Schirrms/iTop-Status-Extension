# iTop-Status-Extension
Add some new Status type in iTop

# object

We needed a new kind of status : 'being decommissioned'. Because, in our Workflow, we sometimes stop system but wait... sometime a long time before actually uncommissioning it'

This extention (at the time of writing) just add that new status. Of course, it would be easy to add other status at well.
